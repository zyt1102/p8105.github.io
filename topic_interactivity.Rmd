title: "Interactivity"
---

Connections between statistical software and web-style output formats allow the incorporation of interactivity into deliverable products, even when those products are not online. In this topic, we first look at the dissemination of products via a website and then explore interactive graphics (scatterplots, bar charts, box plots) and collections of these in dashboards. 

This topic is made up of the following components:

* [Making websites](making_websites.html)
* [Plot.ly and `flexdashboards`](plotly_and_dashboards.html)

The code that I produced working examples in lecture is [here](https://github.com/jeff-goldsmith/example_interactivity).
