The chunk below creates a dataframe containing a sample of size 500 from a 
random normal variable, constructs the specified logical vector, takes the 
absolute value of each element of that sample,and produces a histogram of 
the absolute value. The code chunk also finds the median of the sample and
stores it for easy in-line printing.

```{r learning_assessment_1}
library(tidyverse)

la_df = tibble(
  norm_samp = rnorm(500, mean = 1),
  norm_samp_pos = norm_samp > 0,
  abs_norm_samp = abs(norm_samp)
)

ggplot(la_df, aes(x = abs_norm_samp)) + geom_histogram()

median_samp = median(pull(la_df, norm_samp))
```

The median of the variable containing absolute values is 
`r round(median_samp, digits = 2)`.
