A main emphasis in the course is the use of proper style when writing with data. For that reason, in addition to whatever points are allocated to a particular problem, the following points can be deducted for coding and text sytle issues:

* 1 point: incomplete sentences and lack of explanitory text
* 1 point: poor text formatting
* 1 point: inappropriate whitespace in code
* 1 point: unclear variable names
* 1 point: generally disorganized code

Whitespace and organization is generally covered by the R Style Guide in the Advanced R Textbook. Occasional typos won't be penalized (a missing space or indent is fine) but consistent or egregious errors will be.

Some of this will be "subjective", but members of the teaching team are sufficiently experienced to make informed decisions. Like all grade-related matters, any concerns about style deductions should be directed to Jeff or a lead TA.
