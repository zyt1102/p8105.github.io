### Discussion board

The course's discussion board is hosted on CourseWorks. The discussion board for each module should be used to ask questions about course content -- how code works, why it might not, and possible solutions. The teaching team will supervise the discussion board and respond regularly, but students are encouraged to be active in both asking and answering questions throughout each module.

Some guidance on how best to ask questions on a discussion board can be found [here](https://stackoverflow.com/help/how-to-ask) and [here](https://jvns.ca/blog/good-questions/).


### Office hours

In addition to the resources above, virtual office hours will be held every day; office hour times and locations are available on the syllabus and Google Calendar (on the main course website).


### Email

Email addresses (UNIs) are provided for the instructor and all TAs, and we will try to answer emails promptly. This channel of communication is intended for issues that fall outside of those above, such as questions about course policies or grades.
