We have, by now, established some fundamental tools for doing data science. It's important to revisit our definition, and especially our discussion of connotation, before moving forward.

```{r, echo = FALSE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(
  collapse = TRUE,
  fig.width = 6,
  fig.asp = .6,
  out.width = "90%"
)

library(tidyverse)

theme_set(theme_bw() + theme(legend.position = "bottom"))
```

## Example

This example is based entirely on live-coding and uses the [NYC Airbnb data](dataset_airbnb.html). The data can be imported using the [p8105.datasets](https://github.com/P8105/p8105.datasets) package:

```{r}
library(p8105.datasets)

data(nyc_airbnb)
```

As always, I'll do today's coding in a R Markdown file, sitting in an GitHub Repo / R Project.

### Understanding variables

First, let's take a few minutes to understand the dataset and the variables it contains.

```{r}
# View(nyc_airbnb)
str(nyc_airbnb)

nyc_airbnb %>%
  count(room_type)

nyc_airbnb %>%
  count(neighbourhood_group)
```

### Brainstorming questions

A major element of data science is to ask questions, and this dataset provides some rich opportunities. For example, we might ask:

* Does rating vary by neighborhood, room type, or both?
* How is price related to other variables?
* Where are rentals located?

We'll take a few minutes as a class to brainstorm some additional questions, and then try to answer some of them.

```{r, echo = FALSE, eval = FALSE}
ggplot(nyc_airbnb, aes(x = longitude, y = latitude)) +
  geom_point() + 
  coord_map()
  coord_equal(ratio = 1)
```

```{r, echo = FALSE, eval = FALSE}
library(leaflet)
library(p8105.datasets)

data("nyc_airbnb")

nyc_airbnb = 
  nyc_airbnb %>% 
  mutate(stars = review_scores_location / 2) %>% 
  rename(boro = neighbourhood_group)

pal <- colorNumeric(
  palette = "viridis",
  domain = nyc_airbnb$stars)

nyc_airbnb %>% 
  filter(boro %in% c("Manhattan", "Brooklyn", "Queens")) %>% 
  na.omit(stars) %>% 
  sample_n(5000) %>% 
  mutate(click_label = str_c("<b>$", price, "</b><br>", stars, " stars<br>", number_of_reviews, " reviews")) %>% 
  leaflet() %>% 
  addProviderTiles(providers$CartoDB.Positron) %>% 
  addCircleMarkers(~lat, ~long, radius = .1, color = ~pal(stars), popup = ~click_label)
```
