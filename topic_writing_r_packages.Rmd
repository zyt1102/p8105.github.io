title: "Writing R Packages"
---

Once you've gotten used to writing R functions, you'll find lots of opportunities to write them. That leads to a new problem -- how do you keep track of many (i.e. two or more) functions? Writing R packages solves that problem. We'll cover the basics (package structure, functions, documentation, and deployment) in the first part of this topic, and some advanced ideas (namespaces, testing, vignettes, including data) in the second part. 

This topic is made up of the following components:

* Writing R Packages [Part I](writing_r_packages_i.html)
* Writing R Packages [Part II](writing_r_packages_ii.html)

The slack channel for this topic is [here](https://p8105-fall2017.slack.com/messages/C7WC2UPT7).

The code that I produced working examples in lecture is [here]().
