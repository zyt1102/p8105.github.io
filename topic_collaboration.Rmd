title: "Collaboration and dissemination"
---

Much of the content through this point has focused on the work of a single individual. Data science work, however, often happens as part of a team. Moreover, the products of data science projects (including code for analyses as well as a discussion of results) are typically made public. This topic focuses on collaboration using Git and GitHub, either as an individual or as part of a team; best practices for team data science; and dissemination of products via a website. 

The topic is made up of the following components:

* [Git and GitHub](git.html)
* [Team data science](team_data_science.html)
* [Making websites](making_websites.html)
