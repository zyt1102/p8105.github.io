The overarching goal of data wrangling is to have a tidy, easy-to-use dataset. 

This is the third module in the [Data Wrangling I](topic_data_wrangling_i.html) topic.

```{r, echo = FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(
  collapse = TRUE,
  fig.width = 6,
  fig.asp = .6,
  out.width = "90%"
)
```

## Example

I'll keep using the same repo / project as in [data import](data_import.html) and [data manipulation](data_manipulation.html), but create a new .Rmd for tidying. I'm also going to load some relevant packages, and limit the number of lines printed in a tibble. 

```{r}
library(tidyverse)

options(tibble.print_min = 5)
```

### `pivot_longer`

In [data import](data_import.html), we used the `haven` package to load the PULSE biomarkers dataset from a .sas7bdat. Let's reload those data and take a closer look:

```{r}
pulse_data = 
  haven::read_sas("./data/public_pulse_data.sas7bdat") %>%
  janitor::clean_names()

pulse_data
```

With our new understanding of tidy data, we quickly recognize a problem: the BDI score is spread across four columns, which correspond to four observation times. We can fix this problem using `pivot_longer`:

```{r}
pulse_tidy_data = 
  pivot_longer(
    pulse_data, 
    bdi_score_bl:bdi_score_12m,
    names_to = "visit", 
    values_to = "bdi")

pulse_tidy_data
```

This looks much better! However, now `visit` is an issue. The original column names were informative but we probably don't need to keep the `bdi_score_` prefix in each case. I'll use an additional option in `pivot_longer` to address this:

```{r}
pulse_tidy_data = 
  pivot_longer(
    pulse_data, 
    bdi_score_bl:bdi_score_12m,
    names_to = "visit", 
    names_prefix = "bdi_score_",
    values_to = "bdi")

pulse_tidy_data
```

In the preceding I've saved intermediate datasets to make each step clear. While this can be a helpful crutch as you're trying out code, it is generally bad practice. There are also some additional transformations needed to wrap up the data wrangling process, like changing `bl` to `00m` for consistency across visits and converting `visit` to a factor variable. (It's possible that you would want `visit` to be a numeric variable instead, which could be done with a different call to `mutate`.) Lastly, it's nice to organize the data into a reasonable order.

Altogether, then, the code below will import, tidy, and transform the PULSE dataset into a usable format:

```{r}
pulse_data = 
  haven::read_sas("./data/public_pulse_data.sas7bdat") %>%
  janitor::clean_names() %>%
  pivot_longer(
    bdi_score_bl:bdi_score_12m,
    names_to = "visit", 
    names_prefix = "bdi_score_",
    values_to = "bdi") %>%
  relocate(visit) %>%
  mutate(
    visit = replace(visit, visit == "bl", "00m"),
    visit = factor(visit, levels = str_c(c("00", "01", "06", "12"), "m"))) %>%
  arrange(id, visit)

print(pulse_data, n = 12)
```

Now we're in pretty okay shape :-).

**_Learning Assessment:_** In the litters data, the variables `gd0_weight` and `gd18_weight` give the weight of the mother mouse on gestational days 0 and 18. Write a data cleaning chain that retains only `litter_number` and these columns; produces new variables `gd` and `weight`; and makes `gd` a numeric variable taking values `0` and `18` (for the last part, you might want to use `recode` ...). Is this version "tidy"?

<details>
<summary> Solution </summary>

The code below shows one approach to this data cleaning process:

```{r}
litters_wide = 
  read_csv("./data/FAS_litters.csv", col_types = "ccddiiii") %>%
  janitor::clean_names() %>%
  select(litter_number, ends_with("weight")) %>% 
  pivot_longer(
    gd0_weight:gd18_weight,
    names_to = "gd", 
    values_to = "weight") %>% 
  mutate(gd = recode(gd, "gd0_weight" = 0, "gd18_weight" = 18))
```

In one sense, this is "tidy" because I have a variable for day and a variable for weight rather that using values in my variable names. However, it's less useful if I'm interested in computing or analyzing weight gain during pregnancy.

### `pivot_wider`

We've been exclusively interested in tidying data, but we've admitted that sometimes untidy is better for human consumption. For that reason we're going to take a short digression into untidying your tidy data.

The code below creates a tidy dataset that could result from an analysis. This is the correct format for additional analysis or visualization, but doesn't facilitate quick comparisons for human readers.

```{r}
analysis_result = tibble(
  group = c("treatment", "treatment", "placebo", "placebo"),
  time = c("pre", "post", "pre", "post"),
  mean = c(4, 8, 3.5, 4)
)

analysis_result
```

An alternative presentation of the same data might have groups in rows, times in columns, and mean values in table cells. This is decidedly non-tidy; to get there from here we'll need to use `pivot_wider`, which is the inverse of `pivot_longer`:

```{r}
pivot_wider(
  analysis_result, 
  names_from = "time", 
  values_from = "mean")
```

We're pretty much there now -- in some cases you might use `select` to reorder columns, and (depending on your goal) use `knitr::kable()` to produce a nicer table for reading.


### Binding rows

We've looked at single-table non-tidy data, but non-tidiness often stems from relevant data spread across multiple tables. In the simplest case, these tables are basically the same and can be stacked to produce a tidy dataset. That's the setting in `LotR_words.xlsx`, where the word counts for different races and genders in each movie in the trilogy are spread across distinct data rectangles (these data are based on [this example](https://github.com/jennybc/lotr-tidy/blob/master/01-intro.md)).

To produce the desired tidy dataset, we first need to read each table and do some cleaning.

```{r}
fellowship_ring = 
  readxl::read_excel("./data/LotR_Words.xlsx", range = "B3:D6") %>%
  mutate(movie = "fellowship_ring")

two_towers = 
  readxl::read_excel("./data/LotR_Words.xlsx", range = "F3:H6") %>%
  mutate(movie = "two_towers")

return_king = 
  readxl::read_excel("./data/LotR_Words.xlsx", range = "J3:L6") %>%
  mutate(movie = "return_king")
```

Here it was necessary to add a variable to each dataframe indicating the movie; that information had stored elsewhere in the original spreadsheet. As an aside, the three code snippets above are all basically the same except for the range and the movie name -- later we'll see a better way to handle cases like this by [writing our own functions](writing_functions.html), but this works for now.

Once each table is ready to go, we can stack them up using `bind_rows` and tidy the result:

```{r}
lotr_tidy = 
  bind_rows(fellowship_ring, two_towers, return_king) %>%
  janitor::clean_names() %>%
  pivot_longer(
    female:male,
    names_to = "gender", 
    values_to = "words") %>%
  mutate(race = str_to_lower(race)) %>% 
  select(movie, everything()) 

lotr_tidy
```

Having the data in this form will make it easier to make comparisons across movies, aggregate within races across the trilogy, and perform other analyses. 


### Joining datasets

Data can be spread across multiple related tables, in which case it is necessary to combine or **join** them prior to analysis. We'll focus on the problem of combining two tables only; combining three or more is done step-by-step using the same ideas. 

There are four major ways join dataframes `x` and `y`:

* Inner: keeps data that appear in both `x` and `y`
* Left: keeps data that appear in `x`
* Right: keeps data that appear in `y`
* Full: keeps data that appear in either `x` or `y`

Left joins are the most common, because they add data from a smaller table `y` into a larger table `x` without removing anything from `x`. 

As an example, consider the data tables in `FAS_pups.csv` and `FAS_litters.csv`, which are related through the `Litter Number` variable. The former contains data unique to each pup, and the latter contains data unique to each litter. We can combine these using a left join of litter data into pup data; doing so retains data on each pup and adds data in new columns.

(While revisiting this example, take a look at the `group` variable in the litters dataset: this encodes both dose and day of treatment! We'll fix that bit of untidiness as part of the processing pipeline. I'm also going to address a pet peeve of mine, which is coding sex as an ambiguous numeric variable.)

```{r}
pup_data = 
  read_csv("./data/FAS_pups.csv", col_types = "ciiiii") %>%
  janitor::clean_names() %>%
  mutate(sex = recode(sex, `1` = "male", `2` = "female")) 

litter_data = 
  read_csv("./data/FAS_litters.csv", col_types = "ccddiiii") %>%
  janitor::clean_names() %>%
  separate(group, into = c("dose", "day_of_tx"), sep = 3) %>%
  relocate(litter_number) %>%
  mutate(
    wt_gain = gd18_weight - gd0_weight,
    dose = str_to_lower(dose))

fas_data = 
  left_join(pup_data, litter_data, by = "litter_number")

fas_data
```

We made the key explicit in the join. By default, the `*_join` functions in `dplyr` will try to determine the key(s) based on variable names in the datasets you want to join. This is often but not always sufficient, and an extra step to make the key clear will help you and others reading your code.

Note that joining is not particularly amenable to the `%>%` operator because it is fundamentally non-linear: two separate datasets are coming together, rather than a single dataset being processed in a step-by-step fashion.

As a final point, the `*_join` functions are very much related to SQL syntax, but emphasize operations common to data analysis. 

**_Learning Assessment:_** The datasets in [this zip file](data/survey_results.zip) contain de-identified responses to surveys included in past years of this course. Both contain a unique student identifier; the first has reponses to a question about operating systems, and the second has responses to questions about degree program and git experience. Write a code chunk that imports and cleans both datasets, and then joins them. 

<details>
<summary> Solution </summary>

I put both datasets in the `data` directory in my repo / project. The code below imports both datasets, cleans up variable names, and joins the datasets using `left_join`, `inner_join`, and `anti_join`.

```{r, eval = FALSE}
surv_os = read_csv("data/surv_os.csv") %>% 
  janitor::clean_names() %>% 
  rename(id = what_is_your_uni, os = what_operating_system_do_you_use)

surv_pr_git = read_csv("data/surv_program_git.csv") %>% 
  janitor::clean_names() %>% 
  rename(
    id = what_is_your_uni, 
    prog = what_is_your_degree_program,
    git_exp = which_most_accurately_describes_your_experience_with_git)

left_join(surv_os, surv_pr_git)
inner_join(surv_os, surv_pr_git)
anti_join(surv_os, surv_pr_git)
anti_join(surv_pr_git, surv_os)
```

</details>


### A quick note on names

Up until very recently, folks were using `gather` and `spread` instead of `pivot_longer` and `pivot_wider`. The new functions were updated [for good reasons](https://tidyr.tidyverse.org/dev/articles/pivot.html); `gather` and `spread` will still exist, but they're going to be less common over time.
