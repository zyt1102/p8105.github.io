Not bad,3,"Expected it to be very funny, wasn't very funny. The video quality in the beginning of the movie was fuzzy but that went away. The movie doesn't really have a point, just kinda random comedy."
Five Stars,5,funny
Two Stars,2,Stupidest waste of 1 and a half hours.
Five Stars,5,It's great thank you
Five Stars,5,It worked as brand new and we're happy with this classic comedy.
It doesn't get any better than Napoleon Dynamite!,5,"This is the best movie, ever.  So quirky and funny!  I've probably watched it 100 times!"
Pretty disappointed!,1,"When I opened the actual movie and tried to play it on my DVD, I found that it was a Blu Ray DVD and would not play on my player. I specifically looked for a movie that was not Blu Ray and that information was neither listed in the details of the product description on Amazon, nor on the packaging of the movie itself. Pretty disappointed!"
Five Stars,5,Classic.
Not my show.,2,Was not what I expected. Not my type of show.
Five Stars,5,One of my favorite movies.
Four Stars,4,Hilarious movie!
One Star,1,Finally got a chance to watch this show only to have the disc scratched won't play.

Great Flick,5,I'd give it 6 stars if that was an option

Five Stars,5,Good movie
A must see!,5,Classic movie! A must watch. Great for family nights and some good laughs
Party fun,5,"Watched it as part of a party, just for fun. Most of us had seen it before, but a few were Napolean Dynamite virgins."
One of my favorite films that makes me chuckle & smile,5,"It's Napoleon Dynamite. What can I say; the more I watch it the more I love it, the characters, the deadpan, the 'intensity' of the simplistic."
Five Stars,5,Tots!
Flippin sweet!!,5,Grab some tots and your buddy and enjoy this masterpiece ;)
Five Stars,5,"Awesome movie, cracks me up everytime. A classic for my family for sure."

Mint condition,5,My all time favorite movie . Mint condition. I would def. Order from this company again
Sweet!,5,"I don't know why, but this is one of my favorite movies.  It's great for all ages and has no sexual situations or foul language.  The soundtrack is a little weird but wonderful."
Five Stars,5,Hilarious.
its a cult classic for a reason,5,its a cult classic for a reason
I love this movie,1,"First,  let me say:  I love this movie.  LOVE IT.  Or I wouldn't have bought it.  This review is about how it arrived.  The case is completely smashed and broken.  I have not yet tried the DVD itself.  That looks ok,  although I really don't know how, since the case is mostly demolished.  Disappointing."
Five Stars,5,A
Five Stars,5,This movie is absolutely hysterical. Bought the DVD as a stocking stuffer for my hubby.
Five Stars,5,my granddaughters favorite
Terrible quality for a bluray!!!,1,I bought this as a gift and they had it for a few weeks before they watched it. It was POOR quality the movie skipped and the timing was off. Now unfortunately I've missed the return window. Very upsetting. Waste of money.
Five Stars,5,Arrived new and in perfect condition.  One of our favorite movies.
Five Stars,5,"Made me laugh when it came out, still makes me laugh today."

Five Stars,5,"Jut a great movie,"
Rare and precious.,5,"This movie is crafted by genius. The plot seems simple enough, but is able to reach into us and relate something very personal. The acting is great, by everyone. You would forget it's a movie, but for the spontaneous giggles. I never fail to get chills at the end. Wish there were more movies like this one."
Five Stars,5,"Just as expected, well done"

Gosh!,5,"Here is my review.  My daughter is 10 and we watched this at a party.  The next day, ""Daddy can we watch Napolean Dynamite again?"""
Wrong Disk!,1,"Opened package to watch, had Alvin and the Chipmunks movie inside.  Missed my return window because I didn't check to make sure the right disk was in the case in time.  Very disappointed :-("
It's got dumb humor but it's so funny,5,"We bought this movie for my cousins who had never seen it. It's comparable to Nacho Libre humor wise. It's got dumb humor but it's so funny! If you're looking for a laid back dumb humor type movie, this is it! This movie is extremely quotable!"
Five Stars,5,Good movie
Funny to me...,4,"You have to have the right sense of humor for this movie.  I thought it was great, my wife did not get it at all."
Yeahhhh ummm n0oO,3,Not as funny as it was when I was in high school. The dance in the end was the best part
Tina is my soulmate,5,This is a classic comedy that relies heavily on irony and awkwardness to enrich the experience and advance the plot.
"Good Quality, Poor Packaging",3,"Actual movie packaging was heavily damaged to the point where I had to swap out the case for a second one, which was annoying. Discs looked good and play correctly, I would just recommend purchasing a replacement case to be on the safe side."
This movie is so dumb and so simple but that's what makes it a ...,5,This movie is so dumb and so simple but that's what makes it a great movie. I saw it once when I was around 12 and wanted to watch it again. I'm 21 now and still enjoyed it.

Five Stars,5,a must have classic move
Fun,5,"A well-done movie about a high-school misfit and his eventual triumph.  My kids really enjoyed this movie.Oh, and please ""Vote for Pedro""."
A Classic,5,"Wacky movie with strangely lovable characters.  It's been around for awhile, and now my nieces have discovered it, so I guess it's a classic of sorts."

Too funny,5,"Rolling on the floor, laughing out loud.  And your family may watch this."
Five Stars,5,Thank you!
Five Stars,5,Gosh! Idiots!
Apex of Cinema,5,"This movie is like The Godfather and Star Wars Episode I The Phantom Menace met on the set of Cheers, got drunk, hooked up in Arnold from Hey! Arnold's bedroom. Then, in the same amount of time as it takes to lose a guy in How to Lose A Guy in 10 Days, The Godfather realizes it's pregnant. 28 Days Later (Movie gestation period) the movie Tropic Thunder is born. It grows up in the Truman Show world and meets The Lord of the Rings The Two Towers. They get involved, fall in love, but much like Vince Vaughn's and Jennifer Aniston's characters in The Break Up, they break up. Then Tropic Thunder finds his way to the set of Cheers and meets the spanish language version of Avatar. They have sex (normal sex, not Avatar ponytail sex) and this movie is born. Will watch again."

Five Stars,5,classic
Four Stars,4,Fun
Many others loved this movie,2,"Many others loved this movie, but I was bored with it.  It felt like it was confused as to the date as there were references to '70's, '80's, and '90's.  The friendships were new and shallow, didn't he have friends from past school years?  The martial artist instructor was the only one that mentioned the image that you project, but nobody learned from it."
Clean. Hilarious. Greatness.,5,Clean.  Hilarious.  Greatness.

Good Choice!!,4,"Was looking for a clean humored movie and tried Austin Powers.  That was a mistake, but Napoleon was a great choice."
Know your Inner Napoleon!,5,"Absolutely great. There's a little of him and in his life happenings in all of us, and this movie brings it to the surface and helps you embrace your inner Napoleon!"

You Gotta Love this Kind of Thing...or you just don't,5,"My 14-year-old loves this crazy movie.  As an adult, I can't stand to watch it--pure stupidity. Kind of along the same lines as the movie Dumb and Dumber."

Five Stars,5,Excellent product!
Five Stars,5,Love it
Brilliant.,5,Saw this in the theaters…..Twas Genius then….stands time.  Brilliant.
Crap,1,It was a copied disk wouldnt play on any dvd player kept saying some foreign words.
Five Stars,5,Great entertainment for everyone
Five Stars,5,Love this movie
Still funny,4,"I decided to watch this with my teens and we all laughed a lot. If you ever watch the Miranda sings shows on Netflix, it has a very similar format. I think Amazon charges too much for rentals so I give this a star reduction for that. The movie has a lot of funny one liners and is weird and at times you feel embarrassed for the characters but maybe that's why it's so funny. You can see a little of yourself and your own weirdness and laugh at it.Be sure to watch past the credits for kips wedding. I never saw that scene when this movie first came out so it was something I got to see with the rental."
a family favorite,5,So funny with lines we repeat often and characters we love.
Five Stars,5,Funny
One Star,1,I think I missed something here...? ? ?
Deadpan Funny!,4,A throwback to an earlier time!  Deadpan funny.
Wonderful.,5,"Classic, groundbreaking, and really quotable. Plus, as a farm boy from Idaho, I relate with the characters and situations. When I first saw this movie, it changed my idea of what a movie is. Wonderful."
Unfortunately I cannot provide a review in the sense I didn'twatch the film and only heard of it following my ...,3,i have to say that this film features in my purchases only as my late son encouraged me to purchase it for him. Unfortunately I cannot provide a review in the sense I didn't watch the film and only heard of it following my son heading off and returning to say it was ace. The trailer I did see seemed to depict a trio of misfits if that help in some way.
Five Stars,5,Silly humor at it's best.
Classic,5,"Simple and funny. Develops a bit slow, but enjoyed it."
Five Stars,5,"um duh, its napolean dynamite.  of coarse it awesome"
Odd but brilliant,5,It took me a half hour of watching this movie to get the brilliance of it.  It is very odd but it works.  Each scene and character are very unusual like characters out of an Eighties David Lee Roth video.  I understand why this gained a cult following.
I'd call it brilliant.,5,"Quirky and heart warming, takes several view to get all the humor going on.  I'd call it brilliant."
Funny movie when you're not sure of what you want to watch!,5,"So dead-pan and awkward, it's hilarious. It tends to get funnier each time I watch it."
it was one of my favorite movies in high school,5,"I consider this a classic, it was one of my favorite movies in high school. I showed it to my high school students from a totally different area and the humor translated perfectly. Will always love this movie, think of it, and reference it."
Classic,5,Must see. So stupid it Hillarious

Five Stars,5,Best ever
Gift for daughter as one of her favs,5,One of my daughters must haves. Either you love it or you hate it.
Wasted time - too super dull.,1,"Awful. Couldn't even get through the whole thing. After an hour, nothing was happening. Somebody told us it was funny, but they were so wrong. Dull. That's what this movie is. :("
Laughs,5,Love this movie. Always a good laugh.
"Great first time I saw it, not so much years later.",3,Some movies are better when you see them a second time. This one was barely tolerable the 2nd time. I loved it when I saw it years ago.  My son (12) thought it was worth watching.
Five Stars,5,Great movie
Five Stars,5,Everyone should always vote for Pedro.
Classic movie,4,"Love the movie, but my copie came kind of beat up, doesnt bother me because it was 8$ but still overall satisfied"
"If nothing we do matters, all that matters is THIS MOVIE",5,"Without question the objective GOAT movie.  This got me through every hard time in my life, including when my brother got married and rode off on a horse.  We never heard from him again.  Have any of you heard of ""Citizen Kane""?  That was inspired by this movie."
Five Stars,5,Great value
Five Stars,5,Lol
Five Stars,5,I feel this is the best indie film ever done. At least the best indie comedy.
"Fun and Funny, Beginning  to End",4,"Three words: Quirky, hilarious, and awkward . If you prefer movies that make perfect sense from start to finish, this one is not for you. If you enjoy ""odd duck"" characters, physical comedy, and a splash of eighties music and fashion , then this movie will become one of your favorites."
all around great experience,5,great price.  quick delivery.
Five Stars,5,Too funny!
Five Stars,5,Pretty much my favorite movie.
Absolutely disappointed!! DO NOT BUY,1,"This disc does not even work, looks fake. Absolutely disappointed!! DO NOT BUY!!"
The extras alone are worth the price of this Blu-ray ...,5,"The extras alone are worth the price of this Blu-ray. This low budget film is part of the classics that belongs with ""Breakfast Club"", ""Blast from the Past"", ""Animal House"" "" American Graffiti"" and ""Hollywood Knights""  in your film library."
Gosh!,5,"I love this movie...a classic for sure...Napoleon reminds me of me in High School...though I didn't look so lethargic and spastic, I did have goofy hair and glasses...and I was terrified of girls...got bullied and made all those funny sounds..."
Amazing,5,Best movie ever if you have any sense of humor!!
"Ehhh, it's okay. Not my favorite but my kids enjoyed it.",3,Such an odd movie but my sons quote lines form it all the time. I don't think I'd care to watch it more then once but apparently it appeals to the younger generation.
Four Stars,4,Hilarious!
Five Stars,5,It was a great movie.
Five Stars,5,Better than a Cheese Quesadilla!
Five Stars,5,One of the best movies of all time!
"""I see your drinking 1%. Does that mean you ...",5,"""I see your drinking 1%. Does that mean you think you're fat? Cause you're not. You could be drinking whole if you wanted to.""- Napoleon Dynamite nuff said"
Love the characters & dialogue,5,"One of the funniest movies I've seen.  For everyone who cheers for the underdog & for all of us who aren't part of ""that crowd"".  Love the characters & dialogue."
Painful to watch at times.,3,"It has some moments but it's painfully flat in terms of the energy of the actors, it doesn't feel natural."
One Star,1,Ok random silliness.
Very cute independent movie that seems dumb at first and then it grows on you,5,"Very cute independent movie that seems dumb at first and then it grows on you. ""I've caught you a delicious bass."" Ha! Ha!"
Yes!...Yes!...Yes!,5,"The first time I watched this movie, I actually fell asleep. The next time I watched, I paid more attention and had a few chuckles. Now it is one of my all time favorites. It seems like something new makes me laugh each time I watch. The first few times I saw it, I thought it ended where Napoleon and Deb are playing tetherball. Then one time I let it go through the credits and lo and behold, there was another segment to watch! ""Make yourself a dang quesadilla"" has become a common phrase around our house. Like a new TV series, sometimes you have to watch it a few times to really appreciate it! Just so stupid funny!! Gosh!!"
Cult Classic,5,"Good old fashioned dry, spot-on humor. Perfect soundtrack provides audio landscape for this weirdly awesome film!"
Dry comedy.,1,Dry comedy.
Very slow and boring,2,Funny at times just because of the characters but very slow and boring for most of the movie.
Best movie ever!!,5,"Best movie of all times. The more you watch it the funnier it gets and the more you catch.  Clean humor, no cussing, family movie. I've watched this movie over 150 times and now have my daughter reciting lines."
Five Stars,5,great

Hilarious!,5,Timeless and classic!!!

Five Stars,5,Funny
Love it,5,Love this movie!!
A movie to watch with your kids,5,"I have 3 kids at 15, 12 and 10 years old.  The first time we watched this movie together, they laughed a bunch of times.  Throughout the following week, they were quoting the movie until my youngest son asked me, ""Dad, what was that movie about?"".  I laughed because I didn't know what to say.  I never thought about the meaning.  My kids and I have watched this movie at least 6 times this year.  We laugh harder each time now that we know what is going to happen.If you're in your 40's and are looking for some nostalgic movies to watch with your kids, put this movie in your queue, along with The Goonies, Gremlins, Jaws, The Holy Grail, Joe Dirt, Time Bandits, Stand by Me, and the original Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory.  Your kids will thank you."
Five Stars,5,Thank you!
"Great movie, this!",5,Hilarious and oddly endearing.
Five Stars,5,I love this movie.
Can't go wrong with this flick....GOSH!,5,Just an incredible movie in spite of the minimal budget and DIY set-up. A positive/happy film with iconic characters. Wish I could dance like Napoleon in the school assembly scene.
Four Stars,4,"Great movie... Stupid, BUT GREAT!"
Five Stars,5,Why did this win no Oscars
the more you love it.,5,"The more you watch it, the more you love it."
"Movie is great, but I received uses merchandise",1,"This is my all time favorite movie. The nostalgic feeling I get remind me of senior year of high school when my favorite teacher and I would quote line back and forth all year. Imagine my excitement when I found out it is now on Blu-ray! I raced home today to rip open the package and there it was, sweeter than extra tots and sick jumps. I open up the wrapper on the Blu-ray and automatically the backing feel off. Open up the trifold case and look at the contents. The DVD is completely scratched and dirty, the Blu-ray is only lightly scratch but also dirty. Looks like I received repackaged used merchandise. I will never order from this supplier again."
Classic,5,Classic forever.....
Five Stars,5,::)
Five Stars,5,Great movie!
love love love love love,5,love love love love love. We watch this twice a week and even had a Napoleon Dynamite party complete with corn dogs and tater tots. FUN!!
Five Stars,5,fun
I always look forward to watching the movies I loved with my kids as they grow,4,"I always look forward to watching the movies I loved with my kids as they grow.  This was a great, clean, histerical low budget movie to enjoy with my pre-teen/teen kids!"
Watch this movie it's like flipping awesome!,5,"I remember those days in high school when it was just as hard for others to understand you as it may have been for you to understand them.  I went to a somewhat big school so their were quite the mix of students, clubs, and unfortunately and inevitably clique's.  Their were the jocks, the nerds, the eccentric artistic types, pompous snobs,Goths, class clowns and pranksters, and even some foreign students.  No doubt one could always feel themself in a much better social status by belonging to a clique.  Sometimes you'll belong to either one that's not especially popular and/or has few members or just not be clique material at all.  Other than that some will feel that their worth doesn't need to be measured by a clique in the first place.  High school has it's many posers and real people.  I feel that this movie finds a fascinating way to make one think about all of those elements.Also this movie does a good job of examining the poor and struggling versus the higher class and more well to do.  The exaggerations that this movie goes into with all of that are quite funny and relatable without being too mean-spirited.As this movie is in no way plot heavy it does showcase some funny, interesting, and all around zany characters.  Also it's quite quotable as well.  In this movie you are introduced to Napoleon Dynamite.  A social outcast who's moody and deadpan, gets bullied at times, likes to make up stories, and has few friends.  Napoleon's brother Kip is a suck up, a dork, he's self-righteous, is only a little more tactful than Napoleon, and in general is an all around loser.  Uncle Rico who frequently relives his high school football hey days, he's a free-loader, an instigator, and while he and Kip get along just fine, Uncle Rico and Napoleon totally hate eachother.  Deb is a sweet girl who's just as socially awkward as Napoleon if not more, she was given the task to sell friendship bracelets door to door, she works at a local photo shop, and she has a deep connection with Napoleon.  Pedro is a lively and lovable Mexican teen of whom was sent  locally to Idaho, he and Napoleon become fast friends, Pedro wants a girlfriend, other than that Pedro shares in Napoleon's interests and wishes to win as school president to be respected and to stand out.  Grandma is the caretaker of Napoleon and Kip who loves to do dangerous and extreme things to the point of  getting wounded.  Summer Wheatly is gorgeous, hot, outgoing, highly popular, but unfortunately she's a big snob.  Those are the central characters to focus on.  The rest aren't as important.Some Facts About The Film:  Director: Jared Hess, Producers: Jeremy Coon, Chris Wyatt, Sean C. Covel, and Jory Weitz.  Musical score by John Swihart.  Distributed by Fox Searchlight Pictures for North America and Paramount Pictures internationally.  Budget: $400,000.  Box Office: 46.1 million dollars.  Cinematography: Munn Powell  Theatrical release: June 11, 2004.The funniest scene of all will always be when Napoleon disco dances on stage to Cosmic Girl by Jamiroquai.  Certainly Napoleon and Uncle Rico locking horns is really hysterical.  Kip's ridiculous poser behaviors are very hilarious.  When the grandmother says,""Makes yourselves a freakin' Quesadilla"". is another good laugh.The friendship between Napoleon and Pedro is a great reminder of what a worthwhile and loyal friendship in high school is like.  Deb may not be very pretty but she is that sweet girl that is the right kind of girl to want to have as a girlfriend.  Napoleon keeping his tater tots in his pocket certainly reminds me of any time that I didn't have time to eat all of my lunch so I would bring a ziploc bag and pack it for later.All in all, as I don't normally find movies with clean humor to be funny nor do I normally care for a movie that's plot light and character heavy, I can't deny that with this movie's charm, zany and quirky characters, quotable lines like ""Sweet or ""Lu-cky"", it's hilarious exaggerations about clicques, class, and popularity, chief characters that are likable and only a couple that aren't, Jon Heder staying perfectly in character throughout the movie, great cinematography, and it's non mean-spirited nature, are all things that make this movie one that's worth giving a try.  Hopefully one day there will be a sequel."

Five Stars,5,Hilarious movie!
Somewhat of a sad movie. Bad parody on life in rural nowhere,1,Somewhat of a sad movie. Bad parody on life in rural nowhere.  Unfortunately there are a couple memorable moments that are hard to forget.  I could not recommend this movie to anyone even to those who like offbeat comedies.
I enjoyed it,3,"It's a solid three star movie. I'm glad I finally saw it and it made me laugh out loud a few times, but I wouldn't feel the need or desire to see it again."

Five Stars,5,One of my favorite top 10!!!
Five Stars,5,We love it!
You are gonna love it or hate it,4,"There is a love/hate relationship with this movie at my house.  I am not a big fan, however everyone else loves it.  I had to take one star off because I walk away when someone puts this movie on.  That being said, I do appreciate that the movie was originally written and performed by students and then picked up by a major studio and redone, with some if not all of the same actors.  I do like Jon Heder, though some of his films are really stupid.  If you are into mind numbing comedy, this is one for you.  I know it is now a cult classic, so you should probably watch it whether you want to or not."
If you haven't seen this what are YOU waiting for !!! Hilarious!!,5,If you haven't seen this what are YOU waiting for !!! Hilarious!!
Life changing experience,5,"Napoleon Dynamite has literally changed my life. Because of this movie, I survived high school and learned some sick dance movies. Napoleon taught me the importance of self defense, and that nun chucks are a must. This movie will truly turn your whole life around."

A quirky and original comedy.,4,"Though this starts out slowly, stick with it all the way through, as it's well worth finishing. This is the kind of comedy that grows on you, getting funnier with repeated viewings. A family favorite!"

Great movie.  Fast shipping.,5,Buy this now!  One of my family's favorite movie.  The bluray is a huge plus.
Best movie ever... GOSH!,5,"Just shows your age when you find this movie hilarious and remember the 80's and early 90's. I found that most people that aren't amused by this movie were born after 95' so I guess kids can't really understand it. Puffy dresses, big hair, trapper keepers, and caboodles. It reflects a time most of us want to forget but can't quite help laughing at. We all knew someone that one of the characters reminds us of. Whether it be Napoleon, Kip, Deb, or Uncle Rico... it's a classic. If only we could go back in time..."
Five Stars,5,Yes!!!!
"Brilliant, funny",5,"Brilliant, funny, perfectly acted, scripted and shot for next to nothing.  Heck yessss!  The BUMMER of the whole thing is that, as a guy who pays$$$$ for Amazon Prime, -- they charged me $3.99 to watch the damn thing."

"Pretty funny,but silly",5,Pretty funny but silly too. I enjoyed it.
Four Stars,4,Love the juvenile humor for mindless tv time.
One of my favorites,5,"“Napoleon, don’t be jealous ’cause I’ve been chatting online with babes all day. Besides, we both know that I’m training to become a cage fighter.” With lines like this in a movie, how can you go wrong? If you like off the wall, odd, and often times very subtle comedy, you will love this movie. Jon Heder plays the role of a lifetime in this movie. I have watched this over and over and never tire of it. You results may vary."
Five Stars,5,I'll never get tired of this movie.

Five Stars,5,This movie deserves a 6 star rating
Five Stars,5,Vote for Pedro.
What?,2,"No plot, no likeable characters, everyone in the movie seems to have been intentionally made not just average, but far *below* average in all aspects. There are a few scenes that elicit a couple laughs, but for every one of those scenes there are a dozen that challenge you to care about anything going on in them. That this movie was ever any sort of a success makes me lose hope for humanity."

A classic,5,Always a safe choice
Surprisingly Fantastic Show!,5,"Wasn't sure if I'd enjoy this flick and was most pleasantly surprised, a description wouldn't do this movie justice, just watch it!"
Three Stars,3,Hilarious satirical example of high school life.
Freakin sweet!,4,Still funny after all these years. Instant classic. Kip is one of the most underrated characters in movie history.

Two Stars,2,I had watched this movie many years ago. It's still just okay.
Vote for Pedro,5,"It's s classic, something I never thought I'd say the first time I watched it with my nephew years ago. Now I've seen it five times or more and it gets funnier each time."

One Star,1,I like offbeat things but this was just plain bad. Very disappointed. Didn't get past first half-hour.
Five Stars,5,classic
"Funny, goofy",5,"Quirky in so many respects, and yet a delightfully charming story where the hero, as human as anyone of us, does win.  The soundtrack adds a textural layer that really does enhance the development and portrayal of each character.  Funny, goofy, and you'll want to watch it more than once."

Five Stars,5,Perfect
Five Stars,5,"Fave movie, fast shipping"
One of our all time favorite movies. We just love it,5,"One of our all time favorite movies. We just love it. Its a cult classic of course. It is one of those movies that either a person loves it or hates it, no in between happening here. The stuff that happens it just so stinking funny, who thinks like this? It is a good one for sure. I recommend it to anyone that has a great sense of humor; you cannot take this movie seriously or you will not like it."
cult classic,5,I love this movie and my wife has said that it took watching twice to love it.  Now our kids love it.
Whatever I want!,5,"What a fun, silly movie! One every young teen should see as a right of passage...along with The Princess Bride, Bill and Ted's Excellent Adventure and a few others."
Classic,5,"This movie is a classic. It is mostly about life in the midwest for awkward teen Napoleon and his best friend Pedro. The dialogue is hilarious as well as the characters, which are stuck in a semi retro world were things are barely going."
one of the best cult films ever,5,"hands down, one of the best cult films ever."
Five Stars,5,Awesome

Five Stars,5,Great!
Five Stars,5,Great deal
Five Stars,5,Love it!!
A great oddball but sweet teen movie,5,"A great oddball but sweet teen movie, which works on so many levels. Napoleon is the ultimate an anti hero's hero. The school dork turned hero. All the characters that surround him are unusual and extreme. Warning to those who expect non stop excitement, it's slow! However, if you persist, you will be rewarded. Plus best use of a Jamiroquai track since Godzilla!"
Classic,5,"Classic worth watching every couple of years. Plus it was filmed in Idaho, making it close to home as well."
Five Stars,5,TOTS!

It was great for mom and dad to relive the funny moments ...,5,"Hilarious movie! I've watched it many times before but when my 12 year old asked about it the only place we could find it was amazon so we watched it that night. It was great for mom and dad to relive the funny moments of our first time watching it, and it was great because it made my son laugh the whole way through. He is now walking around our house repeating many lines from the movie such as the ""are you going to eat your Tater-Tots"" line! Thanks for making this movie available to us to watch again when no one else did!"
Two Stars,2,Pointelss movie.
Five Stars,5,Stupid Funny. Showed the kids for the first time. They loved it too.
a beautifully done movie,5,"a beautifully done movie, steeped in irony and cleverness, and with its muted emotional range of expression, kind of to our times what anti-heroes were to the 60's. In its delicious spoofing of ordinary American life, it leaves us with a sense of the joy we can still eke out of the bleak landscapes in which most Americans live, almost without realizing we are doing so. A minor masterpiece."
Five Stars,5,Very funny movie...Napolian - just eat the D#@% Ka sa dillas~!
Five Stars,5,Awesome!!
"Make a sequel that rises up the so called ""nerds.""",1,"Terrible movie that makes fun of ""nerds.""My family thinks I'm taking it too seriously, but I do not.Someone make a movie that raises up the disenfranchised who attend public and private schools. They need to be raised up more than any others. Let's get real people!"
Extremely lame! Maybe as a high school senior project,1,"low budget Bill Murray knock-off.  Extremely lame!  Maybe as a high school senior project, but not for national release.  Please!"

Four Stars,4,Warning: you'll find yourself quoting from this movie all the time.
"Fun movie, appropriate for the family",5,"Definitely campy!  Absolutely no plot (although some family members disagree with that opinion), but just fun and funny!  One nice thing is that it is totally clean... no offensive language, nudity, sexuality, or drug/alcohol references."
To funny!,5,"Cult classic, some get it, others don't."
Great lines,5,"A great movie that you can watch with your kids that will make you laugh out loud.  A bit quirky but that is what is great,"

Love this movie,5,"Love this movie! The more I watch it, the more I pick out new things that I didn't notice before."
Five Stars,5,Brilliant film.
Some of the 80's jokes/references were fun to see,1,"This is $4 and 1.5 hours of my life I can't get back. Some of the 80's jokes/references were fun to see, but that was about it. I don't see why folks like this movie so much."
Quirky and funny,4,Quirky and enjoyability. The movie is a funny reminder of the mid 2000's. I watched it with my younger teenage boys and they loved it.
Five Stars,5,crazy cult classic.

The kind of movie you either love or hate,5,"I'm pretty sure this is the kind of movie you either love or you hate. I think it's great, especially if you lived through the 90s. It's just quirky and ridiculous and rather heartwarming."
Five Stars,5,one of my favorite movies EVER.
Five Stars,5,Awesome movie! Get your own tots!
Silly fun,4,"Everyone knows this movie is supposed to be stupid fun, and that's just what it is."
great,5,Have a ten year old son that had never saw this movie laughed the whole movie
Classic!,5,How can you not like Napoleon Dynamite....It is a classic!
Five Stars,5,Sweet
Does nothing but improve with age.,4,"This movie is funnier every time I see it.  Therefore, I now own it.  It puts the quirk in quirky.  I'm not sure what I like more, the fact that it is 2000's Idaho stuck in 1984 or the random musical doodling on a casio electric piano that is the soundtrack (along with built in background rhythm line.)  It has one of the most surprising upbeat endings of any movie out there.  If you've never seen it, it is definitely worth watching and if you have, watching again."
Five Stars,5,Best movie ever.
wow.,1,"Let me start by openly admitting that I am an 80's throwback and proud of it. I understand that my era did not produce horribly intelligent, deeply touching movies. That being said, this movie puts the Du-h! in Dumb!!  My teenage daughter had seen it a sleepover, so we rented it so she could show me how silly it is for our girly night.  She actually got tickled at a few spots on her second run through it. I sat open mouthed, amazed at the sheer senselessness of the whole thing...waiting desperately for a plot or growth of a character. None came. Since we had it rented for the weekend, she showed it to her older brother the next night. She giggled again, and he snickered with a confused look on his face once in a while. Then we couldn't let my Hubby miss out on the sheer stupidity of it all, so we watched it with him on Sunday afternoon.  Our daughter and son both snickered here and there, mostly at the looks on their parents' faces.  My husband was, as was I, gobsmackered. We kept looking at each other as if to assure each other that it was indeed that painfully dumb.  The only real emotion I felt was a horribly heartbroken, sick to my stomach feeling for Napoleon and his friends for being so awkward and socially inept...I remember kids who struggled in school that way, and I always almost cried every time I saw them in a tough situation.  If anything it brought back bad memories of school....who needs that?  Anyway, all this to say it is a story about an awkward boy who uses bluster and dumb responses to deal with not fitting in.  It follows (if you can exaggerate and say there is a plot) him as he finds friends (just as goofy as he) and finds romance...sort of."
One Star,1,dumb as dumb can be
Five Stars,5,So funny!
It's a great movie you idiot,5,It has skills
Five Stars,5,Hilarious
Wish I wouldn't have seen it.,2,"I was really hoping to laugh more. I wanted to. I just couldn't. I knew it was going to be ""dumb"" humor from what I had been told. Sadly it was lacking in the humor potion.There is really no plot buildup. I'm not sure what the point was."
Five Stars,5,<3 me some Dynamite!
Four Stars,4,my Grandchildren like it
Tina you fat lard! Come get your dinner😂,5,Funniest movie i have seen
Five Stars,5,"Funny, eclectic, clean, loved it!"
Vote for Pedro!,5,Classic parody of life in some parts of Idaho! lol
Goofy comedy,4,"Quick story recap. Napoleon Dynamite is the biggest geek in the world and this movie just follows him, and his nerdy brother Kip, family and friends.  His friend Pedro runs for class president and Napoleon does his best to help.Acting wise, Jon Heder is perfect as Napoleon, He nails the type of guy everyone has known or met at least once in your life.Overall it's a goofy but funny movie. There are some lines that crack me up and Napoleon's dance is awesome.  It's a fun way to kill some time."
Silly Movie..  Vote for Pedro,5,Silly Movie.  Great Blu-ray transfer.
Three Stars,3,A classic.
Highly Entertaining,5,This is one of my all time favorite movies. My whole family loves it. The music is great. The actors make the characters come to life and are so believable. It touches all me emotions without making me feel any particular way too strongly.
One Star,1,Dumb movie! Can't believe I watched it.

Napoleon Dynamite - Must See,4,"This movie was all the hype when it came out, and it still stands up with some extremely funny moments, like when Rico throws a steak at Napoleon. The movie follows a strange and awkward boy, Napoleon, his new friendships, and his family. Everyone lives kind of a depressing life in the middle of nowhere Idaho. If you haven’t seen this cult movie, you must have been locked up in a closet or something."
"Funny movie, Easy time downloading rental from",4,"Funny movie,Easy time downloading rental from Amazon"
One Star,1,Not at all what I thought it was going to be.  I fell asleep.

If you like subtle humor this is your movie,5,It took me like three hours to finish this review. Tina is starving and grandma's coccyx is on the mend.  Lloyd has made the steaks and uncle Rico just found a way back to 1982.  Excellent movie to watch half a dozen times. You'll find something new every time.

don't bother with it,1,Not worth your time.
You either get it or not.,4,"You either like this movie or just don't get it at all.  There's not much middle ground.  For a guy who grew up in the 70's/80's in the middle mass of students, not popular or unpopular, it connects on a level that's not easy to describe.  It's low budget, but I liked it in an inexplicable way."

Napoleon Dynamite,5,"The first time I seen this movie I thought it was kinda dorky and slow but I couldn't stop watching it. Afterward I kept thinking about it for weeks. Not everyone will get this movie but a whole bunch of us do. I was not a nerdy type in high school but this movie brought back memories of those who fit that description. I'm sure every high school had at least one Napoleon Dynamite, Pedro and Summer. You have to laugh many times while watching this movie and so it was entertaining and a trip back in time for me. I recently added it to my home movie collection so I can share it with others and enjoy it myself from time to time. Highly recommended!"
funny film.,5,"Very strange, funny film."

"This is by far my sons favorite movie, 10yrs ago he still enjoys Napoleon",5,"This is by far my sons favorite movie, 10yrs ago he still enjoys Napoleon. Its a kind of silly, dumb humor movie, with a geeky boy and equally geeky family. When I originally saw it I thought what a weird show but when it came on my son always wanted to watch it. Give it a shot you might just like it."
Five Stars,5,Love it

so so,3,"give it  3 stars out of 5,"
Buy it if you want. Gosh.,5,"I would not recommend watching this if you are someone who gets annoyed at ""dumb"" movies. It is so dumb it is funny. It is a great movie, but many people just hate it. Which I understand. But if you like to quote movies with your friends, this has so many quotable lines it is very much worth buying. Best line? ""Your mom goes to college"" (smirk.)"

Five Stars,5,Very funny!
and it did not disappoint. Because if not for all that,5,"This is one of my first reviews; I have no idea how to fit my star ratings of each into the overall picture. Things may change as I add to the volume and I hope I get to re-review stuff as I develop my critical perspective. for now, suffice it to say, it is tops. The deadpan acting was believable and that really made it for me. The right amount of tension; of teasing my sense of expectation was important, and it did not disappoint. Because if not for all that, it was just another stupid-funny movie like Porkies or something. So I rate it high and I hope you like it as much as I did."
Awful movie,1,"This has to be one of the worst movies ever. Even my kids, aged 12 - 16 thought it was stupid. We turned it off after 45 minutes. Don't waste time or money on this movie."
and enjoy every viewing,5,"I've watched it several times now, and enjoy every viewing.  I suppose I'm a ""cult follower"" at this point."

"As weird the third time as the first, but just as fun",4,"Low budget cult classic, originally given to us by friends who could not imagine our children reaching adulthood without the benefit of having seen this movie. The first viewing explained why we had seen so many ""Vote for Pedro"" t-shirts when we were in SE Idaho. Watched it again (3 adults and 4 teenage boys) the other night, laughing, cringing, moaning, snorting and generally enjoying ourselves and looking for opportunities over the next few days to say ""luuckyy"". Happy to eat a quesadilla (don't turn the double-l into a ""y"") but don't need the tater tots."

Four Stars,4,"Great fun, just for the low key ridiculousness. I crack up every time I watch it!"
weird.. then funnier later,5,"Thereare so many reviews of this already that go into details that I will skip to the thing that matters.  You will probably not think this is super funny the first time you see it.  Then 2 days later you will catch yourself saying ""Your mom goes to college"" and other one liners from the movie.  You will remember it as way funnier than it seemed while watching it initially.  Also, a second viewing months later will be funnier than the first.  In other words, it grows on you like an aggressive humor fungus."

Uggghhhh!!,5,This movie gets more and more hilarious every time I watch it. There aren't many movies that actually make me laugh out loud...this is one of them. Love it!
What's it like to be That Guy?,5,"All the schools I attended had somebody like Napoleon: nerdy for certain, often weirdly hostile, but pretty nice if you managed to get to know them. If you ever wondered what it'd be like to be that guy (or girl), Napoleon Dynamite will show you. It will also make you wince, laugh, clap, and maybe even dance for happiness.Napoleon's home life is odd: he and his 32-year-old brother Kip live in the Middle of Nowhere, Idaho, with their grandmother and her llama, Tina. Kip stays home ""chatting online with babes all day"" while Napoleon starts another grueling school year, teased by jocks and bullies, and bossed around by Grandma. But this time he makes two new friends, glamor shot photographer Deb and Mexican transplant Pedro Sanchez. At last, his life starts to change for the better--even after Grandma gets in an accident and creepy Uncle Rico comes to stay while she recovers.Most people will either love or hate this movie. The dialogue is stilted (for effect, it seems), the humor is subtle, and Napoleon's actions are often puzzling. As with his real-life counterparts, he can be hard to figure out. Yet he's always true to himself, sometimes with bad results. But more often they're good, and by the end of the movie, you understand what he's all about.The best part of the storytelling, for me anyway, was how the events of the movie just unfold, without judgment or explanation. The director, in other words, doesn't try to tell us what to think--and that's what makes Napoleon Dynamite refreshingly, wonderfully different from pretty much any other teen movie you've ever seen. The neutral perspective may be what caused many critics, including the late Roger Ebert, to pan the film. I guess that's understandable for people who are more used to codified teen films like Ferris Bueller's Day Off, where Ferris's perspective dominates so much that he even tells the audience when to go home.But if you have even a little weirdo in your personality--and unless you're Summer Wheatley, you do--you might like Napoleon. I sure did. Here's hoping that this style of storytelling will continue to grow in popularity and produce more classic movies."
This Movie is FUNNY,5,I like Napoleon Dynamite this movie is hilarious and me and my family were laughing a lot at this film. Some parts are stupid but funny and i like it and that's what makes this film different then others!
Love Napolean,5,"Napolean Dynamite is a must see for this generation.  Being from Idaho, its especially fun to see the depiction of eastern Idaho.  You see vote for pedro t-shirts, now see the movie."
Napoleon! Gosh!,5,Again crappy dvd case for a newer purchased dvd but this movie keeps me laughing! I love Napoleon Dynamite and the humor is great and not dry if you look at it in the right way! :)
Thank you,5,"If you enjoy quirky movies, this is the one for you. Some esoteric humor, but some good general laughs as well."
A classic,5,Seems we never get tired of watching this movie. The movie is quoted often and each time we watch we seem to pick up one more line to incorporate into or conversations.
Nerd..over Uncle Recco,5,"The nerd wins, vote for Pedro, Summer Weatly..Rex Kwon Do self defense system,we work on the buddy system, no more flyn solo, just break the wrists & walk away..I love Lafawnduh. .so many great lines.."
Eat your ham Tina!!,5,OMG...love this flick! Talk about laughing your a** off!!! Every character is awesome!!..love Kip & laFonda together!! Ligers and cage fighting!!! Haha
Funny Movie,4,If you haven't seen it it's worth a watch.  Not much more to say about it.  Darn this min word limit.
Classic,4,"Hilarious movie that draws you into and soon has you rooting for one of the quirkiest main characters ever! Napoleon Dynamite shows teen angst, awkwardness, innocence and optimism in a way that no other can - he's an everyteen!  Fantastic and he's appropriately surrounded by other zany characters, along with a simple and compelling plot that keeps you riveted and cheering for him throughout the movie."
no plot,4,"it was funny and a cute story , the only thing that bothered me is that there was no plot"
i don't get it.....,1,"I feel like I lost brain cells watching this movie. I did not see a point to the movie. There were a few mildly funny moments, but overall, not a funny movie. I watched it because everyone I know told me what a great movie it was. I must have missed that part. Super slow and just didn't do it for me."
The Potato Famine is over.,4,Reminds me of why I love Idaho so much. An excellent companion piece to the recent GOP gubernatorial primary debate on Idaho PBS.
Legit,5,Just straight up the best movie you will ever watch and you know that because I never do these stupid reviews so that makes this one worth it
NP movie,5,"Oh my goodness we love this movie and quote it all the time-my 10, 13, and 18 year old and I all laugh hysterically at it. It is a cult classic. The price was great and I even got a NP devotional to go along with it as it is part of a high school graduation gift for my son. It will be fun to own. We just watch it over an over. You'll either love this movie or hate it. If you hate it, it is because you don't ""get"" it. I have to laugh at the reviews that say ""the actors can't act."" Really? This isn't a drama. Where else do llamas get their casserole dinners chucked at them? Make sure you watch after the credits for Kip's love song! We laugh so hard we cry at this movie."
Nope,1,"I've heard so much hype about it, and in the end it was not worth renting to be quite honest."
Love this movie!,5,Love this movie... You must watch it more than once to get it. After that you will watch it nonstop!
"Strange, but funny",3,"Strange but funny. It's a different sense of humor , I get it and liked it, but some people don't like it"
Loved it!,5,"Funny!  If you liked Raising Arizona, you'll love it. A good message about self acceptance and the value of friendship"
Best movie ever,5,Nobody could possibly know that... This is one of my all time faves. Got the dvd quick and it was brand new.
Most boring movie ever!,2,"While there were some funny parts of this movie we find ourselves repeating, I suggest skipping the movie and just looking up the one-liners on YouTube instead.  Save yourself a lot of time and avoid sitting through this film.  It's agony!!!"
Still fun after all this time.,4,"I pulled this movie up to show my jr.higher. We laughed hard. I must have watched this movie over ten times by now, but sharing it with someone who had never seen it was a blast.  So many classic, quotable lines and the best high school dance scene ever.I gave it four stars for staying fresh after all these years."
Who can resist?,5,"I've seen the movie at least 150 times in the past two years, and got this as a present for someone who doesn't have the movie but loves it.  Bonus, this person lives with me, so I get to watch it also...  Totally didn't get it just for that reason?The serious aspect of this movie is I guess the social status in highschools, the importance of said status, and the troubles of growing up.  The weird thing is that nobody in the ""lesser"" status seems to care that they're there, it only matters to the higher-up students.  Does that mean they've gotten over this whole charade of ""power"" based on who you are, or that they've accepted their fate as losers?  And is either of those things something that the viewer should learn from as a good example?  There's a lot going on in this movie under-the-cuff that once you notice it really gets you to think.Then there's the fact that this movie just can't be any more hilarious.  ""Tina... eat the food!""  This movie immediately brightens me up, and I will nevereverever get tired of it!!"
The oddest movie!,5,Yes this is probably my favorite movie!  Some unusual characters to say the least.  Not dirty at all.  Just odd humor.
great movie,5,Such a funny movie! It shipped fast and arrived in perfect condition. My family loved it and we watched it the night it arrived.
Must watch more than once to appreciate it.,4,"Funny movie but you have to watch it more than once to really appreciate it.  When you first watch it, it seems really stupid, and it is. But the second time you watch it, it will crack you up."
So entertaining,5,I loved that I could watch this with my kids and not have to deal with sex scenes and a lot of language.  My 11 year old loved it so much that he was Naopleon for Halloween last year.
bad quality,1,movie kept freezing and pausing. I like the movie but was not able to watch the hole thing through with out it freezing
Not nerdy...simply stupid`,1,This movie is more of an insult to the life of the many who are margined in school.Perhaps I was expecting a turn around and a heroic ending as it has happened in life - just look at who rules the world today... nerds!I would not recommend this movie to anyone.
Best movie ever!!!,5,the quality of the movie plays well for it to be an older movie. Excellent film. love it love it.
Too Funny!!,5,This movie is family friendly. The characters make you to relate to your own friends haha. I recomend this to anybody that likes comedy!!!
Love this movie!,5,This movie is so great!  Hilarious.  Clean.  What more can you ask for?  Definitely watch if you want a laugh.
Tots!!!!!,5,"I liked them movie, and bought it for my sisters and I to watch because we make so many references from it overall hands down one of my favorite movies!"
Movie still has plenty of laughs in it,5,"I watch this with my young kids, it's a movie that doesn't have cuss words and teaches them to be themselves. Still a great flick!"
Napoleon Dynamite is dynamite!,5,"This is a very good move,I bought it for my step grandson who ran for president of student consuls and won .this move has something like this in it . I would recommend this move for school age kids. I am very satisfied the amazon products they are great!!"
Awesome,4,"I understand how some people might miss the humor in this film since it is delivered in such a dry way, but that is the beauty of it.  It was clearly designed to allow the viewer to see the humor in a ""normal"" life experience in this simple town.  Very entertaining."
hilarious,5,When I started watching the movie I thought it's some high school slapstick comedy but soon enough I was caught in it and I couldn't stop enjoying it for a sec.
An American Classic,5,"An American classic about true friendship!  A dysfunctional family life gone good!  You'll laugh, and laugh.  A great, clean American movie."
Napoleon Dynamite,5,It is a great movie good for watching it with the family. This movie is also hilarious and goofy I recommend it
Makes you laugh!,4,Funny and crazy movie and good for the whole family!  It is clean and we don't have to worry about what might be heard or seen.
A must see to be a part of American pop culture!,5,Funny as ever!  I could watch this movie three times in a row.  Or at least three times a year!
No problem with disk,5,"Case has a notch cut out of it, otherwise great condition.I love this film more every time I watch it. Be sure to watch through the credits, there's a wedding!Try watching with the commentary, very interesting.""Do you think anyone want's a round house kick to the head while I'm wearing these bad boys?!"""
Midwest cultural anthropology,5,"Having grown up in a small town in the Midwest, I resonated with this comedy on many levels as a satire of the rural Midwest. I can't even remember how many times I've watched this film . . . I own the DVD and still can't resist watching it whenever it comes on a cable movie channel! If this is a cult comedy, I guess I'm a full-blown cult member!The movie is hilariious because of the quirky dialogue and outrageous character satire, making fun of the usual cast of high-school types - the popular cheerleader and primo jock, the school bully, the wallflower, the nerd, the alienated immigrant.  There's also the anti-PC jabs, such as eating beef steak for breakfast, lunch and dinner with no veggies in sight! For me the interest lies in how the movie presents a cultural anthropology of the changing rural Midwest.We know the internet is changing the world, and we see this in the movie when Napoleans' brother leaves for Detroit with an inner-city girlfriend he met through an internet chat room.Immigration is also changing the rural Midwest, as we see in Napolean's friend Pedro moving to small-town Idaho from Mexico.The family is also changing - Napolean lives with his grandmother and brother with no parents in sight.Thankfully, there were no drugs in the movie, even though they are changing rural America as much as anything."
#1 funniest movies ever made,5,I find it to be the ultimate most hilarious comady made. Me and my coworkers talk about and imitate this movie daily
Give In!,5,Never been a fan of slapstick humor or humor that ridicules others and I just knew this movie would be both of those - but I was persuaded to watch it and I have to say I laughed much more often than I thought I would. The family loved it.
Classically slow awesomeness!!!,5,The movie is classic and awesome but at times gets a little slow.  I feel bad for laughing at certain parts but over all a fantastic movie.  My 9 and 11 year olds really liked it too.  Some language but nothing they don't hear in school already.
So gosh dang funny!,5,"You have to see this, its only like the best movie ever! Better than a having your own pet Liger!"
amazingly funny,5,"A true classic that stand up with Animal house, Christmas vacation and Caddy shack. Even my kids liked it. It's a must see."
FUNNY and QUIRKY and TRUTHY,5,There's a sweetness and a mocking in this film.I like it when even the characters who have room foremotional growth aren't vilified.
Oldie but goodie,4,The movie is dated but it was funny - that kind is dry humor.  I can see how some people would not get it.
Great Fun!,4,"This is a fun, quirky movie that is very unique.  It is not deep or complex; just shallow and funny.  And, ironically, it gives a pretty accurate look of what life is like in Idaho, the Dakotas, Iowa and other upper mid-west areas.  There are a lot of lines, looks and expressions that we quoted and mimiced for months/years from the time we first saw it.  ""I guess you could say it's pretty serious."""
What was all the buzz about?,1,"The second worst movie I've ever seen (after ""Clifford""). ""Vote for Pedro?"" So what? And what about all those college-age actors pretending to be high school students (including the ""stars"")?"
"Very goofy, very quotable film",4,"Napoleon Dynamite is both hilarious and awkward, as too often through the film I found myself identifying the the protagonist, who painfully reminds me a little bit too much of me during my teen years, a geeky outsider in school, doing his own thing, associating with characters just as wacky as himself.  It's a very funny film with a number of touching scenes nestled in, filmed as if in some sort of strange 80's vortex.  There are a couple scenes that might be a little inappropriate for young kids, but otherwise this is a great window into the life of a bizarre yet hilarious character."
I donn't know,3,It was a Christmas gift and I haven't heard if the person I gave it to liked it or not.
Great comedy,5,"An instant classic, so many quotable moments and hilarious situations. One of those movies that can create an instant conversation when you meet someone who's seen it"
Fun movie,4,Fun movie... Was able to watch with my 11 year old son without cringing at any obscenities. Yay!! It's not often I get to watch a funny movie that's not animated with my youngsters. :)
Napoleon Dynamite movie on DVD,5,"I was in search of this movie, reminiscing, and was glad to encounter this vendor. The DVD was completely satisfactory and I has absolutely no issues with it."
Hilarious!,4,"This movie never gets old for me. It has definitely become a classic. Makes me laugh every time! Would recommend, especially if you have an odd sense of humor."
A Classic Sleeper Hit,5,"I bought this indie movie for my 13-yr-old son, who had never heard of it before.  (I saw the movie years ago.)  In the past month, I think he has watched it well over a dozen times and can quote scenes.  It's hilarious and touching all at the same time.  A great addition to anyone's movie catalog."
Featuring features,4,"I am not reviewing the movie, but the Blu-ray DVD.When I buy movies, its because I want to see the special features and commentaries and out-takes, and deleted scenes because these things give me more to enjoy about a movie I already like. Sometimes the collection of features add substantial value and insight; sometimes they add none.This DVD has an impressive collection of features, including multiple commentary tracks.I hope this helps!"
5 Stars for Pedro,5,"You won't need numchuck skills, bow hunting skills, computer hacking skills or the abilty to draw a Liger to enjoy this hilarious classic. Vote for Pedro!"
Best movie ever!,5,"Epic, brilliant, hilarious. I love this film so much, I consider sharing it with my friends as a form of enlightenment.  It never gets old."
Got it for Christmas from my son.,5,"He is 16 and we watched it 3 times already and laugh all the way through it. If you get this type of humor, then you will want to watch it over and over again. I don't usually watch a movie over and over, but recycle them every few years. There is just something really funny about this movie. Maybe because even the cool kids are total dweebs, and no one seems to notice how weird they all are."
Watched It Many Times.,5,This was a funny comedy and humor is hard to create. All the actors came through in being believeable. I would recommentd this to friends who need a laugh.
Movie,3,I gave this as a gift and have not seen it. The recipient has told me that he liked it very much.
Love it,5,"I actually ordered this for my 15 year old son, I saw the movie when it initially came out. Its so stupid its funny."
"OMG, Instant Cult Classic",5,"For those of you who haven't seen this movie, you have to.  Don't judge a video by its cover or poster.  This movie is so strange and quirky that you can't help but ROTFLAO!!! :)"
OMG dont waste your money this movie is horriable,1,What a bad movie.  Wouldn't even recommend to my worse enemy.  Bad. Bad.  Not sure why any studio fund this
Favorite movie,5,"I find this movie absolutely Hilarious!  The caracters are all so odd and funny, that it makes the rest of us feel normal!"
Slow and ridiculous - Not worth the time it took to watch even half of it!,1,Slow and ridiculous - The acting was horrid! I would never waste the time to watch it again or recommend it to anyone.
love this,5,"It's great and has really interesting extras including, cast narratives version that is hilarious, actual auditions for the parts of the main characters. Extras about John header such as outtakes, PELUCA the film short that spawned all this! Much more too much to mention! Your wildest dreams will come true!"
Best movie ever,5,Our family loves this movie - Gosh!  We have watched it multiple times and have it mostly memorized.  It has applications to all parts of our lives.  We can use the phrases where ever we go!My daughter wants a Liger.
FREAKIN IDIOT!!!!!!!,5,"man this movie is hilarious, my favorite parts in the movie are napoleon dynamite drawing a picture to his date to go to the dance and he draws her really funny, give me some tots napoleon, no get your own, and uncle Rico is hilarious. and don't forget to vote for pedro"
Unique and funny,5,This movie is quirky fun.  It's one of those movies that gets better the second and third watching.  A must for any movie library.
Daughter very happy!,5,Purchased for my daughter for Christmas - very happy! She's always liked the movie and wanted her own copy. Great deal.
Doesn't hold up.,3,I watched this in the movie theater and probably a dozen times on DVD shortly after it came out on video.I hadn't seen it for probably 6 years and decided to buy it.It doesn't hold up.
Don't waste your money with movie mars,1,I have never been able to watch this movie. Movie mars sent a DVD that is only compatible for other countries.
Funny baby!!,5,This movie is as cool as hell! I love every part of this movie! The whole movie that is spot on funny! Everyone should have this movie in your collection!
My experiences with Napoleon Dynamite.,5,"I live in Preston, Idaho and I am a neighbor to Jared Hess. I watched the filming of this movie during the month of July the summer it was filmed in Preston. My grandson attended most of the filming hoping to be seen in the movie. He is in quite a few scenes. A couple of days before the last day of filming I was invited to be the secretary in the high school scene. (a job I held for 17 years). It has been a fun experience especially when we travel and people find out we were in the movie.  If they like the movie, we tell them we were in it. If they didn't like it we just move on. Their loss! When I say ""we"", my husband was with me in the wedding scene and the other person I travel a lot with is the teacher who tells Napoleon on the stage that he needs a skit. Anyway it has been a great adventure. I live across the street from the Llama, Tina and we have had a lot of people stop in to talk about the movie. Lyle, the man who killed the cow lives less that a mile away and I still take family and friends to meet him. Most of the pranks and etc. were actual experiences that took place in Jared's family with his five brothers."
One of the best movies from this generation!,5,CLASSIC! This is one of my all time favorite movies. I love the simplicity of it and the entire story. It's just one of those movies that you can watch over and over again.
"""BUY IT YOU IDIOT, GAWD!!!""",5,"""This movie is awesome, the movie it, its incredible, so that means you should totally go and but it!""  Sincerely,  -Napoleon Dynamite..."
Great classic,5,"Great classic movie, everything about the movie is funny.  Highly recommend to anyone who hasn't seen this one, it was seriously underrated when at the theaters."
A classic for the decade of the 2000's,5,"This is a new classic. We enjoy it as a family (kids age 9 & 10 found humor in it) and there are so many memorable scenes/lines.My son chose the name ""Pedro"" for his nickname in Spanish class, and thankfully the teacher was in on the joke."
"A weird, weird movie.",3,"It's just a weird, weird movie. It's funny, but in an uncomfortable way. I knew kids like this in high school. Maybe I was one of these kids in high school. *shudders*"
Awkwardness overload (in a fun way!),4,"What a great movie!It's a classic that everyone should have. It's weird and really awkward, but that is the fun part about Napoleon Dynamite.It's not the typically bullied guy, It's Napoleon (and that's the only way I can describe him!)It is not necessary to have in blu ray, quality is the same as a DVD (in this movie), but for the price difference i think you should get de blu ray (as i did).Great gift for movie lovers!"
My new favorite movie!!,5,My new favorite movie!  Love the humor in this movie and see why it has become a cult favorite. so funny!
Wonderfully Funny.,5,"Great movie and an icon in its time.  Not for everyone, but I love it. This is a must see!!"
DVD with wrong country code will not play,1,"the movie is great, but this DVD is terrible because it was made for a different country code and will not play on a US DVD player--and that was not disclosed on the ad anywhere I could find."
A Favorite,5,This movie cracks me up everytime I watch it. It is a favorite to keep on the DVD rack. Watch at least once.
Vote for Pedro!,5,"It makes me laugh every time I watch it...  Lighthearted, no sex, no violence and doesn't need it.  Yes it is silly and stupid but that's on purpose.............Gosh!!!!"
What the hell was that!!!,1,What the hell was that!!!Watched a total of 10 min.....Don't spend 1 minute on this thing. Not worth it.
Best Movie Ever,5,This movie is the best movie I have ever seen! It's so hilarious! Just watch it ok? You will love it!
"Great cult following movie, a must own for fans",5,Who can't love this movie?  Its just beyond silly and the actual timeline just makes you wonder.  They seem to have internet access yet dress like they're in the 70's.  They have music from the early 90's.  Its just the kind of movie you can watch over and over.  The extra features were kinda nice.  Outtakes from certain scenes were interesting.
Nice,5,"A great movie you can watch with your kids! It is very clean. Well, Uncle is a little creepy but by today's standards it is clean."
Vote for Pedro,5,One of the best movies ever! Love it beyond funny great jokes seriously a great movie if you get the jokes!
Too much fun!!!,5,We love Napoleon Dynamite!!!!!  We have watched it several times since we got it. So silly it's funny.  Gotta have it!
movie,5,I gave this a high rating cause I love this moving! I would recommend this movie to every one that loves a good laugh!!
Different!,5,"This movie is so stupid that it goes back into the funny zone again. It's a different kind of movie and some will probably not like it. Unlike many movies these days, the whole family can watch this one. With a budget of around $400,000 it managed to make $40,000,000. They did something right."
funny,5,"We rented this movie to watch with our teenage girls. They enjoyed it very much, and we did too. It was family friendly which is a big plus. It was just a fun movie."
Awesome Movie,5,"Such a great movie - awkward, funny, touching - completely appropriate for the whole family.We've watched it several times."
It's Napolean Dynamite,2,"Maybe it's just me, but $4 seems like a bit much for a 24-hour rental. I expected it to be cheaper, especially as a Prime member."
GOSH!!!,5,"What can I say about the great Napoleon Dynamite? First off, you either love it or don't get it. If it is your first time watching it, I suggest watching it with people who love it, makes the film much more enjoyable. As for me, its sitting on my shelf next to airplane, white chicks, and other great comedy."
Great Movie,5,"Had seen this movie long ago and forgot how funny, and interesting it was. I was particularly interested in the town it was filmed in and watching the movie gave me a nice view of the location. Well worth viewing more than once.As far as streaming on Amazon. I was a bit dissappointed when I could not stream from my Ipad to my TV. So had to watch on my computer."
Rip off,1,The DVD didn't work. We used it in three different DVD players and an xbox and a ps3 and nothing extremely disappointed and feel ripped off. Won't be using Amazin again
Great movie,5,"Great for families, my 10 and 13 year old love it! Awesome one liners. A must watch comedy, very funny."
So Sweet,5,"Love this touching, funny (in a soft way), quirky movie.  I could watch the dance scene over and over again!"
Eat your Food Tina!!,5,This movie made me laugh so hard I nearly choked on my tots...seriously though it is one of the best movies ever ;)
Could be a classic,4,"If you like movies about kids in high school going through what kids in high school go through, but with a somewhat off beat twist to it, you just might like this movie.  It's not one of my favorites, but on the other hand, it was worth watching."
Very funny,5,"Had never seen it, it is laugh out loud funny. If you have not watched yet do yourself a favor and rent it."
Must see,5,"I imagine this is a cult movie, like rocky horror show. Very very entertaining. Watch it with some friends. Share it a lot. the world needs more laughs"
P--- Poor,1,"about 120 minutes i'll never get back, Oh more words required, Should have got drunk or done laundry or something else."
great silly humor,5,One great Movie For A Stressful Day. Does not Require Much Thinking So It Has Become One Of My Favorites.
Fun,4,Appreciate this film more after watching it with my 7yr old son. He loved it! His laugh made me enjoy it!
"So Ridiculous, and so true to life.",5,"The strong point of this movie is the intelligent portrayal of the absurd.  I kept finding myself saying, ""I know that guy!"""
Vote for Pedro!,5,Great movie! I would watch it over and over! I would recommend it to all of my friends and family!
Great,5,Came in original packaging brand new just like advertised.  Great movie and really cheap too.  I owuld recommend to friends.
must have,5,since the first time I watched this movie I have loved it. Watched it so many times and I can still watch it againand always laugh. Hands down a classic and definitely a must have for your collection.
"Orson Welles, Eat Your Heart Out",5,"Napoleon Dynamite is the Citizen Kane of nerd coming of age flicks. ""Yesssss."" is the new Rosebud. In 20 years, it will be recognized as the greatest Idaho film ever made."
Terrific!!!!,5,"Refreshingly unique and enjoyable!!!!!!Good acting. Enjoyable story line. Fun. Funny. Poignant. Re watchable. Non-traditional family with traditional dynamics, presented artfully. Laughed our asses off. Have watched several times. We're voting for Pedro ."
Classic,5,Yes. Very cool. Its a favorite in our home. Clasically funny and a great way to enjoy a boring afternoon.
So weird its funny--a cult classic,4,"This was a low budget movie I heard about but never wanted to see. My kids wanted to see and and I laughed so hard at just how odd it was that I watched a few more times. Offbeat, and fun"
Movie,5,I see it on TV and just had to own it on blu ray great movie funny to great blu ray transfer
Family favorite,4,Bought this DVD to replace the first one we bought because this is a family favorite movie. Arrived quickly and in perfect condition.
Too funny,4,"This movie kills me.Even at 40+ I find myself (and my kids, much younger) quoting lines.It's a classic."
funny,5,"this movie is great and always makes me smile. The extra features on the disk are funny.  Try watching this movie on a ""bad day""."
Funny!,5,This is a family favorite. Its Lighthearted humor. If you were a teen in the 80's this movie is for you!
Love this movie!,5,"The humor is off the wall, but it is very funny.  I recommend everyone give it a shot.  Two more words."
This is an amazing movie,5,I had to buy it on video. It never gets old. I'm really confused by all of the one star ratings. I cant believe there are people that dont get it.
Quirky,5,"You just want to keep watching ... Funny at times ... Definitely must try to watch it.  If you see it all the way through, keep watching through the credits!"
Five Stars,5,Funny movie.
Really?,1,Was the last of my friends to see this movie and I will have to ask what they liked about it.
Wish I Could Get My Time Back,1,Unbelievable.  First I want to know who read this script and thought it should be a movie.  Second I want to know why I wasted the time to watch it (though I didn't make it to the end).  There is nothing redeeming about this movie.  Nothing.
Freaking Sweet!,5,"Great movie. Looks even better in blu ray. Takes a few watches to fully appreciate, but it never gets old.Get your own tots!"
Not my generation,3,This movie was recommended by my 30-something children as being hilarious.  Being a 70-something parent I think we hit the ol' generation gap.  I guess it comes down to what you like.
dvd,5,I Got this for my teenage daughter. She loved it! So' this went over well! It got here on time and was in good condition too
Classic,4,This movie will be a classic right there with some of the other high school greats from the 80's!  Too funny.
Wonderfully funny,5,You either love it or hate it!!  I enjoy very dry humor/silly movies.  I laughed the whole time. Very funny
Humerous,4,Bought this for my dad for fathers day. He thinks its so funny and that's funnier than the movie itself. Great one liners. Everyone can relate to at least one part.
true classic,5,Our family loves this movie.  A definite must for the family DVD library!  It's one of those movies you can watch over and over and never tire of!
Let your GEEK SIDE SHINE...,5,"DVD was received as described, all items included.  I forgot this Special Edition included the Lunch Box or a scaled down version of a lunch box, a metal box just the same...  If you love this movie then you will love this Special Edition Bonus Package.  Excellent transaction, would do business again."
Good movie,5,"Maybe not for everyone's humor, but every time I watch it there is something new I catch. My kids, who grew up during this era, love the throw back items and ideas."
"If you haven't seen it, you should",4,"I bought this a long time ago so sorry for the late rating.  If you haven't seen this flick, you should give it a whirl.  It's pretty funny.  I don't think it's one that anyone would watch over and over, every day but it is worth having in your library."
