## Other materials

This is mostly a reprisal of previous materials, but worth mentioning and re-reading:

* Jeff Leek's [problem forward](https://simplystatistics.org/2013/05/29/what-statistics-should-do-about-big-data-problem-forward-not-solution-backward/) blog post
* Chris Volinsky's ["How Industry Views Data Science Education in Statistics Departments"](https://youtu.be/JLs01Z5baSU?t=1063)
* Angela Bassa's post on why [Data Alone Isn't Ground Truth](https://medium.com/@angebassa/data-alone-isnt-ground-truth-9e733079dfd4) is an excellent reminder about the importance of context in analyzing data
