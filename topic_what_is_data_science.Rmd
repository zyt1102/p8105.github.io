Almost unheard of five years ago, "data science" has become ubiquitous in media, industry, and academia. Because this is a course in data science, we will spend some time understand various meanings of the term, how we'll use it in this class, and how you can learn data science.

The topic is made up of the following components. We'll check out Part I as the course begins, and revisit over the course of the semester.

This paper on [good enough practices](http://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1005510) for scientific computing gives an idea of what we want to achieve in this course, and why we want to achieve it.
