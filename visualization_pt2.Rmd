## Example

I'll create a new .Rmd for this example, and include it in the Git repo / directory for the [Visualization and EDA](topic_visualization_and_eda.html) topic. I'm also going to take advantage of features in the `tidyverse` and `patchwork` packages, so I'll load those next.

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(patchwork)
```

We'll still work with NOAA weather data, which is loaded using the same code as in [Visualization Pt 1](visualization_pt1.html). 

```{r weather_data_create, cache = TRUE}
weather_df = 
  rnoaa::meteo_pull_monitors(
    c("USW00094728", "USC00519397", "USS0023B17S"),
    var = c("PRCP", "TMIN", "TMAX"), 
    date_min = "2017-01-01",
    date_max = "2017-12-31") %>%
  mutate(
    name = recode(
      id, 
      USW00094728 = "CentralPark_NY", 
      USC00519397 = "Waikiki_HA",
      USS0023B17S = "Waterhole_WA"),
    tmin = tmin / 10,
    tmax = tmax / 10) %>%
  select(name, id, everything())

weather_df
```

As a starting point, let's revisit the scatterplot of `tmax` against `tmin` made in [Visualization Pt 1](visualization_pt1.html). 

```{r}
weather_df %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = tmin, y = tmax)) + 
  geom_point(aes(color = name), alpha = .5)
```


### Labels

There are a variety of useful ways to change the appearance of your plot, especially if your graphic is intended to be viewed by others. One of the most important things you can do is provide informative axis labels, plot titles, and captions, all of which can be controlled using `labs()`.

```{r}
weather_df %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = tmin, y = tmax)) + 
  geom_point(aes(color = name), alpha = .5) + 
  labs(
    title = "Temperature plot",
    x = "Minimum daily temperature (C)",
    y = "Maxiumum daily temperature (C)",
    caption = "Data from the rnoaa package"
  )
```

### Scales

Aesthetic mappings determine which variables map to which plot attributes. These mappings have reasonable default behaviors, but can be modified through scales.

For example, you'll occasionally want control over the location and specification of tick marks on the X or Y axis. These can be manipulated in `scale_x_*` and `scale_y_*` where `*` depends on the type of variable mapped to the `x` and `y` aesthetics (i.e. `continuous` vs `discrete`). 

```{r}
weather_df %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = tmin, y = tmax)) + 
  geom_point(aes(color = name), alpha = .5) + 
  labs(
    title = "Temperature plot",
    x = "Minimum daily temperature (C)",
    y = "Maxiumum daily temperature (C)",
    caption = "Data from the rnoaa package") + 
  scale_x_continuous(
    breaks = c(-15, 0, 15), 
    labels = c("-15ยบ C", "0", "15"))
```

There are a variety of other `scale_x_*` and `scale_y_*` options -- it can be helpful to know how and where these are controlled, although I usually would have to google how to do what I want. 

```{r}
weather_df %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = tmin, y = tmax)) + 
  geom_point(aes(color = name), alpha = .5) + 
  labs(
    title = "Temperature plot",
    x = "Minimum daily temperature (C)",
    y = "Maxiumum daily temperature (C)",
    caption = "Data from the rnoaa package") + 
  scale_x_continuous(
    breaks = c(-15, 0, 15), 
    labels = c("-15ยบC", "0", "15"),
    limits = c(-20, 30)) + 
  scale_y_continuous(
    trans = "sqrt", 
    position = "right")
```

For many graph options there are several ways to produce the desired result, and you should feel free to use whichever is most convenient. For instance, `scale_y_sqrt()` can be added to a `ggplot` object to transform the Y scale, and `xlim()` can be used to control the plot limits in the X axis. 

Analogously to `scale_x_*` and `scale_y_*`, there are `scale`s corresponding to other aestheics. Some of the most common are used to control the `color` aesthetic. For example, arguments to `scale_color_hue()` control the color scale and the name in the plot legend. 

```{r}
weather_df %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = tmin, y = tmax)) + 
  geom_point(aes(color = name), alpha = .5) + 
  labs(
    title = "Temperature plot",
    x = "Minimum daily temperature (C)",
    y = "Maxiumum daily temperature (C)",
    caption = "Data from the rnoaa package") + 
  scale_color_hue(name = "Location", h = c(100, 300))
```

Trying to create your own color scheme usually doesn't go well; I encourage you to use the [`viridis`](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/viridis/vignettes/intro-to-viridis.html) package instead. There are several options, but the default color scheme works nicely!

```{r}
ggp_temp_plot = 
  weather_df %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = tmin, y = tmax)) + 
  geom_point(aes(color = name), alpha = .5) + 
  labs(
    title = "Temperature plot",
    x = "Minimum daily temperature (C)",
    y = "Maxiumum daily temperature (C)",
    caption = "Data from the rnoaa package"
  ) + 
  viridis::scale_color_viridis(
    name = "Location", 
    discrete = TRUE
  )

ggp_temp_plot
```

We used `discrete = TRUE` because the `color` aesthetic is mapped to a discrete variable. In other cases (for example, when color mapped to `prcp`) you can omit this argument to get a continuous color gradient. The `viridis::scale_fill_viridis()` function is appropriate for the `fill` aesthetic used in histograms, density plots, and elsewhere.

### Themes

Themes are used to modify non-data elements of a plot -- they don't change mappings or how data are render, but control things like background color and location of the the legend. Using themes can help with general plot appearance.

For example, I frequently change is the legend position. By default this is on the right of the graphic, but I like to shift it to the bottom to ensure the graphic takes up the available left-to-right space. 

```{r}
ggp_temp_plot + 
  theme(legend.position = "bottom")
```

Quick tip: `legend.position = "none"` will remove the legend. This is helpful when multiple plots use the same color scheme or when the legend is obnoxious for some other reason.

While you can manage specific theme elements individually, I recommend using a built-in theme. By default this is `theme_gray`; here's `theme_bw()`:

```{r}
ggp_temp_plot + 
  theme_bw() + 
  theme(legend.position = "bottom")
```

... and here's `theme_classic()`:

```{r}
ggp_temp_plot + 
  theme_classic() + 
  theme(legend.position = "bottom")
```

... and, for some reason, here's the Excel 2003 theme from [`ggthemes`](https://jrnold.github.io/ggthemes/):

```{r}
ggp_temp_plot + 
  ggthemes::theme_excel() + 
  theme(legend.position = "bottom")
```

Don't use the Excel 2003 theme (the first two are fine, and `ggthemes` has other very nice themes as well). 

The ordering of `theme_bw()` and `theme()` matters -- `theme()` changes a particular element of the plot's current "theme". If you call `theme` to change the some element and then `theme_bw()`, the changes introduced by `theme()` are overwritten by `theme_bw()`. 


**_Learning Assessment:_** Revisit the plot showing `tmax` against `date` for each location. Use labels, scale options, and theme changes to improve the readability of this plot.

One possible plot is shown below.

```{r}
ggplot(weather_df, aes(x = date, y = tmax, color = name)) + 
  geom_smooth(se = FALSE) + 
  geom_point(aes(size = prcp), alpha = .75) + 
  labs(
    title = "Temperature plot",
    x = "Date",
    y = "Maxiumum daily temperature (C)",
    caption = "Data from the rnoaa package"
  ) + 
  viridis::scale_color_viridis(discrete = TRUE) + 
  theme_minimal() + 
  theme(legend.position = "bottom")
```

</details>


### Setting options

In addition to figure sizing, I include a few other figure preferences in global options declared at the outset of each .Rmd file (this code chunk just gets copy-and-pasted to the beginning of every new file).

```{r, eval = FALSE}
library(tidyverse)

knitr::opts_chunk$set(
  fig.width = 6,
  fig.asp = .6,
  out.width = "90%"
)

theme_set(theme_minimal() + theme(legend.position = "bottom"))

options(
  ggplot2.continuous.colour = "viridis",
  ggplot2.continuous.fill = "viridis"
)

scale_colour_discrete = scale_colour_viridis_d
scale_fill_discrete = scale_fill_viridis_d
```

There are ways to set color preferences globally as well (for example, to use `viridis` color palettes everywhere, all the time, without setting these options in your RMarkdown file), although they're a bit more involved. 


### Data argument in `geom_*`

We've seen that where an aesthetic gets mapped to a variable matters -- setting `aes(color = name)` in `ggplot` can yield different results than the same setting in `geom_point()`. This arises from the way that `ggplot` objects inherit aesthetic mappings, and it turns out there's a similar thing with the data used to make a plot. 

In a contrived example, we can split `weather_df` into separate datasets for Central Park and Waikiki. Then we use one in the `ggplot()` call and another in `geom_line()`:

```{r}
central_park = 
  weather_df %>% 
  filter(name == "CentralPark_NY")

waikiki = 
  weather_df %>% 
  filter(name == "Waikiki_HA")

ggplot(data = waikiki, aes(x = date, y = tmax, color = name)) + 
  geom_point() + 
  geom_line(data = central_park)
```

More realistically, it's sometimes necessary to overlay data summaries on a plot of the complete data. Depending on the setting, one way to do this is to create a "summary" dataframe and use that when adding a new `geom` to a `ggplot` based on the full data. 


### `patchwork`

We've seen facetting as an approach to create the "same plot" for several levels of a categorical variable, and this can get you pretty far. Sometimes, though, you want to show two or three fundamentally different plots in the same graphic: you may want to juxtapose a scatterplot and a boxplot, or show scatterplots illustrating relationships between different variables. In this case, a solution is to create each of the panels you want separately and combine panels using tools in the [`patchwork`](https://github.com/thomasp85/patchwork) package:

```{r, fig.asp = 1}
tmax_tmin_p = 
  weather_df %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = tmax, y = tmin, color = name)) + 
  geom_point(alpha = .5) +
  theme(legend.position = "none")

prcp_dens_p = 
  weather_df %>% 
  filter(prcp > 0) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = prcp, fill = name)) + 
  geom_density(alpha = .5) + 
  theme(legend.position = "none")

tmax_date_p = 
  weather_df %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = date, y = tmax, color = name)) + 
  geom_point(alpha = .5) +
  geom_smooth(se = FALSE) + 
  theme(legend.position = "bottom")

(tmax_tmin_p + prcp_dens_p) / tmax_date_p
```

The package is already very helpful but is under active development -- some features may change or be added over time -- so check the package webstie periodically to stay up-to-date. This does require some amount of work for each panel, and you should keep in mind that this is intended to help combine panels into a plot that couldn't be created better using data tidying steps. 

### Data Manipulation

Often, struggles with `ggplot` are struggles with data tidying in disguise. Viewing data manipulation as part of the visualization process will often be your path to success! Put differently, the behavior of your plot depends on the data you've supplied; in some cases, it's easier to control behavior through data manipulation than it is through the plot code. 

This is particularly true for the order of categorical or factor variables in plots. Categorical variables will be ordered alphabetically; factors will follow the specified order level that underlies the variable labels. You can change the order level of a factor variable to your specified preference using `forcats::fct_relevel` or according to the value of another variable using `forcats::fct_reorder`. 

A first example reorders `name` "by hand":

```{r}
weather_df %>%
  mutate(name = forcats::fct_relevel(name, c("Waikiki_HA", "CentralPark_NY", "Waterhole_WA"))) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = name, y = tmax)) + 
  geom_violin(aes(fill = name), color = "blue", alpha = .5) + 
  theme(legend.position = "bottom")
```

A second example reorders `name` according to `tmax` values in each name:

```{r}
weather_df %>%
  mutate(name = forcats::fct_reorder(name, tmax)) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = name, y = tmax)) + 
  geom_violin(aes(fill = name), color = "blue", alpha = .5) + 
  theme(legend.position = "bottom")
```

We'll learn more about the [`forcats`](http://forcats.tidyverse.org/index.html) package in [Data Wrangling II](data_wrangling_ii.html). 

A more difficult situation relates to data tidyiness. Suppose I wanted to create a three-panel plot showing densities for `tmax` and `tmin` within each location. More concretely, I want to be able to facet panels across the `name` variable, and create separate densities for `tmax` and `tmin` in each panel. Unfortunately, `weather_df` isn't organized in a way that makes this easy. 

One solution would recognize that `tmax` and `tmin` are separate observation types of a shared `temperature` variable. With this understanding, it's possible to tidy the `weather_df` and make the plot directly:

```{r}
weather_df %>%
  select(name, tmax, tmin) %>% 
  pivot_longer(
    tmax:tmin,
    names_to = "observation", 
    values_to = "temp") %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = temp, fill = observation)) +
  geom_density(alpha = .5) + 
  facet_grid(~name) + 
  viridis::scale_fill_viridis(discrete = TRUE)
```

Our emphasis on data tidiness in previous examples is helpful in visualization. The code below imports and tidies the PULSE data, and creates a plot showing BDI score across visits. Some steps that are helpful in retrospect are using `pivot_longer` to organize the BDI score and visit time variables, and organizing the visit time variable into a factor with an informative ordering.

```{r}
pulse_data = 
  haven::read_sas("./data/public_pulse_data.sas7bdat") %>%
  janitor::clean_names() %>%
  pivot_longer(
    bdi_score_bl:bdi_score_12m,
    names_to = "visit", 
    names_prefix = "bdi_score_",
    values_to = "bdi") %>%
  select(id, visit, everything()) %>%
  mutate(
    visit = recode(visit, "bl" = "00m"),
    visit = factor(visit, levels = str_c(c("00", "01", "06", "12"), "m"))) %>%
  arrange(id, visit)

ggplot(pulse_data, aes(x = visit, y = bdi)) + 
  geom_boxplot()
```

As a final example, we'll revisit the FAS data. We've seen code for data import and organization and for joining the litters and pups data. Here we add some data tidying steps to view pup-level outcomes (post-natal day on which ears "work", on which the pup can walk, etc) across values of dose category and treatment day.

```{r}
pup_data = 
  read_csv("./data/FAS_pups.csv", col_types = "ciiiii") %>%
  janitor::clean_names() %>%
  mutate(sex = recode(sex, `1` = "male", `2` = "female")) 

litter_data = 
  read_csv("./data/FAS_litters.csv", col_types = "ccddiiii") %>%
  janitor::clean_names() %>%
  separate(group, into = c("dose", "day_of_tx"), sep = 3)

fas_data = left_join(pup_data, litter_data, by = "litter_number") 

fas_data %>% 
  select(sex, dose, day_of_tx, pd_ears:pd_walk) %>% 
  pivot_longer(
    pd_ears:pd_walk,
    names_to = "outcome", 
    values_to = "pn_day") %>% 
  drop_na() %>% 
  mutate(outcome = forcats::fct_reorder(outcome, pn_day, median)) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = dose, y = pn_day)) + 
  geom_violin() + 
  facet_grid(day_of_tx ~ outcome)
```

The PULSE and FAS examples involve some fairly complex import, tidying, and plotting steps. They aren't intended to be daunting, but rather to illustrate how closely linked the steps in this process are and to emphasize the need for proficiency in data wrangling tools when conducting exploratory analyses.
